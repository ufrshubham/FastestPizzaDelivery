# Fastest Pizza Delivery (WIP)

A fun little 3D game made for the [Game (Engineless) Jam](https://itch.io/jam/engineless-jam). It is still is development but the basic gameplay is something like this:

- You are owner of a pizza truck and you want to deliver as many pizzas as possible, as fast as possible.

- With your years of experience you've decided to optimize the delivery process by completely eliminating the need to stop your truck. Instead, you launch the pizza directly at customers from a moving truck ðŸ˜….

- Every missed hit means a loss to your business.

- Avoid oncoming traffic (cause your life is kinda importantðŸ˜…).

- Potholes = wasted pizza

Play "Fastest Pizza Delivery" and see much money you can make!
